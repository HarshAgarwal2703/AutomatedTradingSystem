bca3d554-2e39-34d4-9e6a-c840fbcd731b;AAPL;Huawei Revs Up Android Substitute as U.S. Curbs Hit Phone Sales;(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. introduced a more polished and expansive iteration of its HarmonyOS, the operating system it’s developing to replace Android and help China’s largest technology company navigate increasingly strict U.S. sanctions. It also announced plans to offer the software for other phone makers to put on their devices.Speaking at the Huawei Developer Conference in Dongguan, consumer group chief Richard Yu said that Huawei will have beta versions of HarmonyOS 2.0 available for smart TVs, watches and car infotainment systems from today, to be followed by smartphones in December.Huawei’s pitch to developers revolved around the open, secure and distributed nature of the latest OS, making it easy to deploy across devices and screen sizes. The first handsets to support it can be expected next year, Yu added. In a world increasingly split along U.S.-China trade lines, Huawei presented HarmonyOS as a potential go-to operating system for its home market.The world’s biggest smartphone maker admitted that U.S. curbs on its chip supply have impacted smartphone shipments, which were 105 million units in the first half of 2020 after reaching 240 million in 2019, according to company data. Still, Yu focused on expanding the Huawei Mobile Services ecosystem, which now counts 1.8 million developers and 490 million active users. It now supports roughly 96,000 apps and is the third-largest mobile ecosystem after Apple Inc.’s iOS and Google’s Android, according to Yu.Read more: Deepening Huawei Curbs Send Asian Chipmakers PlungingThe embattled Chinese company has been fighting for its survival after the Trump administration imposed a series of sanctions that cut Huawei off from its clients and suppliers. Huawei had to use its stockpiles of components to make products from base stations to smartphones. After Sept. 15, it will lose almost all access to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has been making Huawei’s Kirin processors. Kirin chips have in the past competed strongly against Qualcomm Inc.’s Snapdragon silicon and Huawei has invested heavily in developing its 5G wireless solutions.Without the ability to produce or source components for its own smartphones, the company’s mobile business looks in jeopardy, though that isn’t preventing it from actively developing and expanding HarmonyOS as a long-term alternative to the dominant duo of American mobile platforms.(Updates with number of apps in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Thu, 10 Sep 2020 10:22:10 +0000;AAPL_2020-09-10;0.9790000000000001;0.0

ec54318f-97be-3eb8-bf02-680ea7107ae4;AAPL;Day Traders Unbowed by $2 Trillion Rout Reup Bullish Stock Bets;(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors, whose hand-over-fist buying this summer supported one of the fastest rallies ever, are proving as steadfast as they were prescient.Not only did they hang tough as equities cratered the past few days, data suggests their animal spirits were flat-out stoked by the mini-crash, which erased $2 trillion from equities. Whether indiscriminate buying like this is bullish or bearish in the long run is anyone’s guess. But it is perseverance that will evidently take more than a few brutal days to dislodge.For a day, that conviction paid off. Up 3% Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 Index scored its best gain since April, bouncing from a correction that took all of three days to complete. Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc., day-trader darlings that bore the brunt of the carnage, showed signs of life, with the electric-car maker jumping more than 10%.“You’d probably need to see a lot more pain inflicted before you started to see more hesitance on the part of the retail crowd,” said Alec Young, chief investment officer at Tactical Alpha LLC. “There’s been a pattern where buying the dip has been working ever since the Fed stepped in aggressively back in March and April. It’s been such a successful strategy.”To many Wall Street veterans, a correction to this summer’s almost 80% surge in the Nasdaq 100 was overdue, with the index’s price-earnings ratio expanding to the highest level since the dot-com era. The long-awaited purge began Thursday, sending the Nasdaq down 11% over three days, the fastest correction from an all-time high it ever recorded.While the rout came quickly, it did little to flush out options froth that has been held up as a hallmark of the market’s speculative underpinning. Total call open interest on the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100, which trades under the ticker QQQ, remains elevated. At 3.6 million contracts, open interest for bullish options on the fund is hovering at the highest since March after the fastest 10-day increase since late 2018, before the Nasdaq 100 plunged more than 20%.High options volume in popular single-name stocks has persisted, too. On average over the last three trading sessions, more than 1 million Tesla calls traded a day. That’s 50% above what’s been average over the last 20 days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Close to 2.5 million Apple calls traded on average each day during the selloff. That’s roughly double what’s been typical in the last 20 days.In the broad market, bullish bets are still elevated relative to bearish wagers. The Cboe put-call ratio’s 5-day average hovered near a 20-year low of 0.41 in late August. While the measure has climbed to 0.52, it trailed the historic average of 0.65.To Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., there’s still plenty of froth prevalent in the market. For evidence, he points to the “huge” volume in Apple calls that expire on Friday.On Wednesday, as shares of Apple jumped, the most actively traded options were call contracts with near-term expiration dates. An Apple call with a $120 strike price, expiring Friday, saw volume exceed 178,000.“That’s evidence that people did not get scared off by the three-day decline we just saw,” he said. “It’s usually not the first decline that scares investors -- especially the less-experienced individual investor. The thing that really scares them is when the first bounce fails.”Amid sudden turmoil, retailers are standing firm. Small traders’ option flows actually increased last week, according to Options Clearing Corp. data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. At TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., stocks such as Apple and Microsoft Corp. continued to be popular with their clients over the last few days even as they fell, according to JJ Kinahan, the chief market strategist at the brokerage.Drubbings in Apple and Tesla aside, against a market where the S&P 500 dropped 7% over three days, selling by retailer investors appeared to be more muted broadly, going by the performance of their favorite stocks. A basket of shares they’ve been buying, tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was down only 1.8% during the same stretch.“Until we get another scary-enough pullback or decline that scares people, they’re going to continue to have this buy-the-dip mentality,” Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “The Sevens Report” newsletter, said by phone. “What we’ve seen the last couple of days is not even close to scary enough.”Partly lured by commission-free brokerage apps while stuck at home during the pandemic, day traders have flocked to the market, building a presence whose relative heft trails only market makers and independent high-frequency traders. Individual investors now account for roughly 20% of U.S. equity trading, up from 15% historically, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence.As violent as this month’s retreat looked, it pales in comparison to the hefty gains accumulated over the past five months. The Nasdaq 100 is up 30% this year, finding support at its 50-day average. Shares of Apple have gained 60% and Tesla is up 338%.“We saw the fastest -10% in Nasdaq and there wasn’t a huge rush to buy puts,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at Bay Crest Partners. “I wouldn’t say it’s froth, but more so complacency.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Wed, 09 Sep 2020 20:39:11 +0000;AAPL_2020-09-09;0.9766;0.0

a306ed50-7382-3820-ae2c-06110bd670be;AAPL;Apple Design Teams Develop Special Face Masks for Employees;(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has developed masks that the company is beginning to distribute to corporate and retail employees to limit the spread of Covid-19.The Apple Face Mask is the first created in-house by the Cupertino, California-technology giant for its staff. The other, called ClearMask, was sourced elsewhere. Apple previously made a different face shield for medical workers and distributed millions of other masks across the health-care sector.Apple told staff that the Face Mask was developed by the Engineering and Industrial Design teams, the same groups that work on devices such as the iPhone and iPad. It is made up of three layers to filter incoming and outgoing particles. It can be washed and reused as many as five times, the company told employees.In typical Apple style, the mask looks unique with large coverings on the top and bottom for the wearer’s nose and chin. It also has adjustable strings to fit around a person’s ears.The company, which confirmed the news, said it conducted careful research and testing to find the right materials to filter the air properly while not disrupting the supply of medical personal protective equipment. Apple will start sending the Apple Face Mask to staff over the next two weeks.The other model, the ClearMask, is the first FDA-cleared surgical mask that is completely transparent, Apple told employees. It shows the full face so people who are deaf or hard of hearing can better understand what the wearer is saying.Apple worked with Washington-based Gallaudet University, which specializes in educating deaf and hard-of-hearing students, to choose which clear mask to use. The company also tested it with employees in three Apple stores. Apple is also exploring its own transparent mask options.Before designing its own masks, Apple provided employees with standard cloth masks. It also offers basic surgical masks to customers visiting its retail stores.(Updates with details on ClearMask testing in penultimate paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Wed, 09 Sep 2020 19:34:23 +0000;AAPL_2020-09-09;0.9638;0.4019

60a96e6e-961f-339e-a32b-122c31ca99c9;MSFT;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Plan Has Big Problems;"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The latest round of the gaming console wars has officially begun. Following a protracted standoff between Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. over which company would share their plans first, Microsoft blinked first, revealing its Xbox launch details this week. Of note, the software giant is releasing two tiers of devices at different price points. It’s an unprecedented move, but will it pay off? I am not sure.Responding to industry speculation, Microsoft confirmed on social media the existence of the long-rumored next-generation Xbox Series S console, along with its low $299 price and Nov. 10 release date. At the same time, the company also will roll out a higher-end Xbox Series X for $499. As of yet, Sony hasn’t revealed pricing or release date details for its next-generation PlayStation 5.The stakes couldn’t be bigger for the two console rivals. The video-game industry has already thrived amid the pandemic as an attractive option for in-home entertainment. As consumer habits get more ingrained, analysts believe the sector may offer one of the brightest growth prospects over the next few years. And it is a enormous opportunity. Research firm Newzoo projects the overall gaming market will grow to nearly $200 billion by 2023 from an estimated $160 billion this year. Even entertainment executives that have long downplayed gaming are increasingly intrigued. In an interview with Variety, Netflix Inc. CEO Reed Hastings said video games were one of the key categories his company is looking at entering in the future.So, what is Microsoft trying to do with its new strategy? With the two-pronged device offering, the company is hoping it can gain share by attracting hard-core gamers — who crave the best performance — with the Xbox Series X, while also accommodating the casual, price-sensitive customers with the cheaper Xbox Series S. Microsoft also plans to emphasize its Game Pass service, which gives its subscribers affordable access to a library of more than 100 games for a $10 monthly fee. Microsoft’s plan may seem to make sense on paper, but it has several big flaws. First, the naming convention is a confusing mess. One can imagine the poor store sales clerk, who has to explain the differences between the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and the prior generation’s Xbox One S to the average consumer. In contrast, Sony’s proposition of PlayStation 5 as being much more powerful than the PlayStation 4 is a more concise message. Second, and more importantly, success in the video-game industry has always been about which company can offer the best, exclusive gaming experiences.Unfortunately for Microsoft, its new hardware strategy doesn’t fix this deficiency, where it lags far behind its Japanese competitor. Simply, the Sony PlayStation’s lineup of exclusive franchises is unparalleled. This year, the game maker has already generated record-breaking sales numbers for its original games such as Last of Us Part II and Ghost of Tsushima, presaging further strong results for those franchises. And Sony has already announced upcoming PlayStation 5 titles in key series such as Horizon, Gran Turismo and Spiderman. Microsoft’s lineup doesn’t have the same cachet. To add insult to injury, the company’s anchor title for its next-generation console launch, Halo Infinite, was recently delayed to next year on the back of development complications.The existence of a cheaper Xbox console may be a critical problem in itself. Earlier this year, a Sony executive said his company believes “in generations.” What he meant was that by launching games specifically designed for the high-performance PlayStation 5, Sony could attract gamers with releases that take full advantage of the advanced technical capabilities and features of the new console. Therein lies the negative consequence of releasing the under-powered Xbox Series S console, which has one-third the graphics performance of the Series X. The inexpensive console’s anemic horsepower will force developers to dumb down their games to work on the lowest-common denominator device. That means Sony’s games will likely have better visuals and more immersive gaming worlds versus the Xbox counterparts.Even if Microsoft was able to roughly match its rival’s attributes point-by-point, it wouldn’t be enough. Sony has the advantage of the large user base it has acquired during the current generation, which engenders an enormous switching cost for its users. According to Jefferies, the console maker has sold about 110 million PlayStation 4 consoles since 2013, compared to Microsoft’s roughly 50 million units. In its latest financial report, Sony said it had 45 million subscribers for its PlayStation Plus service, which enables online multiplayer functionality for its users. Since tens of millions of PlayStation owners have built up in-game social connections playing games on the Sony platform, they will likely upgrade to a PlayStation 5 to maintain their gaming relationships and access to their PlayStation 4 games, all things being equal. Bottom line, Microsoft’s two-tiered strategy that attempts to make next-generation console gaming more affordable misses the mark.

a3c133e5-f05d-3f18-a3f6-aa146ce42079;MSFT;ByteDance Is Poised to Miss U.S. Deadline for TikTok Sale;(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd. is increasingly likely to miss a Trump administration deadline for the sale of its TikTok U.S. operations after new Chinese regulations complicated negotiations with bidders Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.ByteDance probably needs beyond the U.S. executive order ban on Sept. 20 to nail down an agreement with either party because of the regulatory review, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. In preliminary talks with Chinese officials, ByteDance has been told any proposal must be submitted for approval with detailed information about technical and financial issues, and the review will be substantial and take time, one of the people said. The officials haven’t been willing to give specific guidance on what kind of deal would work, the person said.Microsoft and Oracle, which had submitted proposals before the Chinese regulations hit, both continue to be interested in buying the U.S. arm of the hit video app and have not been dissuaded by Beijing’s involvement, the people said. The bidders have asked ByteDance to get as much clarity as possible from Beijing on the new regulations, which prohibit the export of certain artificial intelligence technologies that TikTok uses, they said.The parties are still racing to present a preliminary deal to the White House before this month’s deadline, though no agreement could be finalized before Beijing’s signoff. It’s also possible that ByteDance pulls out of a sale altogether if it determines it can’t satisfy both governments, the bidders and its own shareholders.A company representative offered no immediate comment.ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has been caught in a clash between the world’s two preeminent powers. The serial entrepreneur has been reluctant to give up U.S. TikTok from the start because he sees the business as a viable long-term competitor to Facebook Inc. and Google. He came under pressure to cede control when the Trump administration said it would ban the app and his own venture investors pressed for a sale to salvage some value from the operation.The Trump administration is divided over whether to give ByteDance more time or simply proceed with the ban. Donald Trump himself has called the app a national security risk, passing an executive order to ban the service this month and approving a separate decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, to force a sale by mid-November.ByteDance has sued in the U.S. to block the executive order ban, arguing that putting it out of business without adequate notice and a fair chance to respond deprives it of its due-process rights in violation of the Constitution. The Beijing-based company has also denied its app represents a security threat and said no data from American users is shared with China.In negotiations earlier this year, ByteDance had attempted to work out a U.S. sale that would allow it to retain a substantial interest in the American operations, but the Trump administration has pushed back on that idea. Zhang would still like a small slice of the operation, the people said. But Microsoft and its partner in the deal, Walmart Inc., want full ownership of the business, one person said, while Oracle’s stance isn’t clear.Analysts and bankers have estimated TikTok’s U.S. business is worth at least $20 billion, although the price would vary widely depending on what is included with the sale. The specific offers from Microsoft, which is teaming up with Walmart Inc., and Oracle, which has won support from venture backers such as Sequoia Capital, could not be determined.China made its 11th-hour entry into the TikTok process the last weekend of August, just as ByteDance had two offers in hand and planned to review them in hopes of making a final decision by the close of Sunday, a different person said. Beijing’s move blindsided the company, this person said.Without any discussion or public announcement, China posted notification of new restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including speech recognition and techniques for personalizing content. The aim of the rules is not necessarily to block a sale of the U.S. operations, but to ensure Beijing is actively involved and to slow down the process, one person said. The review may well push finalization of any agreement beyond the U.S. elections in November, the person said.TikTok’s algorithms are not a big sticking point for the bidders, the second person said. Both Microsoft and Oracle have the technical chops to build their own algorithms and would get data to fine-tune them, the person said.ByteDance’s regulatory team and deal negotiators have discussed whether it’s still possible to craft a sale that can win approval from both governments, an acquirer, venture investors and ByteDance itself.Zhang is still operating from a position of strength. Privately held ByteDance is already worth $140 billion, according to startup tracker CB Insights, and is said to have generated more than $3 billion of net profit on more than $17 billion of revenue in 2019.Investment bankers have begun pitching Zhang’s team on going public in China or Hong Kong, even amid growing scrutiny in the U.S., and demand for initial public offerings from technology companies in the market is surging. Zhang stands to make billions no matter what happens with Trump and TikTok U.S.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:05:26 +0000;MSFT_2020-09-10;0.9967;0.1027

The original contender for the role was Holland, a Netflix veteran for almost close to two decades. Holland was attributed with playing a major role in licensing popular shows like &quot;House of Cards,&quot; &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; from other companies. Reportedly, she would exit the company in October.Why Does It Matter: Bajaria was the head of the local-language series division and Holland was more focused on North America. A Wall Street Journal report claimed that Netflix&#39;s focus on international content and users is growing and this was one of the reasons why Bajaria was promoted over Holland.After being appointed Co-CEO, this is the first shakeup by Ted Sarandos to streamline how the Netflix content team operates, as pe Bloomberg. In the new hierarchy for the content division, Scott Stuber will overlook the global film team and Bajaria will be responsible for the TV.Price Movement:  Although NFLX dropped 1.75% during trading hours on Tuesday, it rose marginally by 0.30% to close at $508.50 in the extended trading hours.See more from Benzinga  * &#39;More Money Chasing Fewer Stocks,&#39; Mark Cuban On Why He No Longer Actively Trades(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

It has shed roughly $17 billion of market value since Monday as SoftBank’s big bets on high-flying tech stocks from Amazon.com Inc. to Alphabet Inc. spooked investors.Investors are grappling with recent market turbulence, assessing whether the pullback for equities is a sign of market health or the start of a larger drawdown that has further to go. Tesla Inc., which had defied gravity and market watchers for much of the year, was the worst performer on the Nasdaq 100 Index Tuesday, which fell 4.8% amid a selloff in equities. SoftBank has said it held $122.9 million worth of the automaker as of June 30.“Even more than SoftBank’s actual exposure, it’s the very act that’s disconcerting,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “Investors are very wary about ‘style drift.’ The question becomes ‘what are we investing in when we buy SoftBank? And is SoftBank a better investor than we are?’”Read more: SoftBank’s Big Options Bet Tests Investor Faith in Masayoshi SonSoftBank held stakes in 25 of the world’s largest technology companies worth about $3.9 billion as of June 30, according to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated Aug. 17. The portfolio included $1.04 billion of Amazon stock, its biggest investment, a $475 million stake in Alphabet, $248.6 million of Adobe Inc. and $189 million of Netflix Inc.The Tokyo-based company booked a 65.4 billion yen ($617 million) gain on the sale of some of the holdings, it said in a presentation to investors on Aug. 12. SoftBank said it invested more than 1 trillion yen in “highly liquid listed shares” and sold 564.9 billion yen, all in the same quarter. The report made no mention of derivatives tied to those investments.SoftBank disclosed in August that it was establishing an asset management arm to trade public securities and said it could use derivatives. What has alarmed shareholders is that Son appears to be using options to amplify his exposure amid rising concerns over valuations being inflated by mercurial individual investors.The Financial Times reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion on options focused on tech stocks with an overall exposure of about $30 billion. The company is sitting on paper profits of about $4 billion in gains from those stakes, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.The speculative fever that drove bullish bets in options markets and saw shares in bankrupt companies surge broke in September, wiping out trillions in market value.Read more: SoftBank Chief Compliance Officer Has Left the CompanyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Wed, 09 Sep 2020 02:07:40 +0000;NFLX_2020-09-09;0.9728;-0.4939

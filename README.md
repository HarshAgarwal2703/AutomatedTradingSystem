# AutomatedTradingSystem
Stock market provides a platform for people to buy and sell shares for profit. However, stock market is highly volatile and no human can rightly predict the direction of stock market, which may lead to high losses for investors. The paper proposes a system which removes the limitations of the existing systems with the help of different machine learning modules.

# Objective(s)
To develop a client-adaptive automated stock trading system that
uses filters in the initial stage to narrow down scope of the stocks,
Predicts stocks prices, performing risk analysis and recommends
different trading strategies to the user to select on the basis of the
risk score.

# Problem Definition
The limitations by traditional trading has restricted the stock
market penetration to less than five percent of the population. The
mere removal of these limitations by the existing automated
systems often result in giving rise to additional problems like
computation power, inaccurate performance, etc.
